<p>The major challenges I faced in this course was when we got to the CSS chapters. The modules I found most difficult was Module 4, with the HTML links. I did have a bit of trouble creating my CSS menu and I can say that it took me the most time out of all the assignments. I also had trouble with understanding the difference between div class and div id, but I did use W3schools to learn a bit more information. <br><br>I think that a few short videos, such as the ones I used from Sasha Evdakov on YouTube, can help explain or help visualize a few steps in using CSS.  I am a visual learner and used a few videos on YouTube to add to what I had already read in my book. I am so glad I took this course because when I was younger, I used to create what was called a "siggy", with hex code numbers and pixels and then we got cut off from the WWW and I never touched a computer again until high school. I loved every part of this course and I am planning on extending my education.</p>
