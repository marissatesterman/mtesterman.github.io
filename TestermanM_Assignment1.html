		<h3>Philosophy</h3>
		<p class="b"> Service is my number one priority. I have a background in data entry after working as a supervisor for an answering service for over six years. Details as small as the error of one number can prevent communication between two companies, such as an urgent medical call or an urgent attorney call. </p>
		<p class="b"> I believe that it takes a special person to work in library services, especially in the age of digital literacy. Attention to detail, such as protecting one from "fake news" is important. Teaching these skills to our youth and adults will help create informed digital citizens. Teaching them attention to detail, such as the checking the url, consulting and comparing sources, and fact-checking stories is critical to their education. </p> <br>
